## 📊 About the Project

For two years, I tracked key aspects of my daily life to understand and manage my personal challenges.

**Metrics tracked:**
- Life events and major stressors
- Coping mechanisms (e.g., cigarettes, alcohol)
- Physical health and stress levels

**Goal:**  
To identify patterns, understand how I coped, and find what actually helped me heal and move forward.
